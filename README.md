# tinyxxd

`xxd` is a utility that comes with ViM. This is a standalone fork of `xxd`, a slight modernization of the C code, a slight performance increase and a drop-in replacement for `xxd`. The target platform is Linux.

### What is it, and what can it do?

The `xxd` utility is a command-line program widely used in Unix-like systems for creating a hexadecimal dump of a given binary file. Essentially, it converts binary data into a human-readable hexadecimal format, often for the purpose of debugging or examining the underlying data structure of files. It displays each byte of the input data as a two-digit hexadecimal number, often accompanied by its ASCII equivalent, if printable. Additionally, `xxd` can reverse the process, taking a hexadecimal dump and converting it back into binary. This functionality makes `xxd` a versatile tool for both inspecting binary data and performing conversions between binary and human-readable formats.
